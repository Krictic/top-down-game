# Game Project

This repository contains a simple game project built with Python and Pygame. This game is in its early stages and far from completion. The game is a 2D RPG game where the player can move around a grid, encounter mobs, and engage in combat with them. The player has attributes such as health points (HP), experience points (XP), gold, and potions. The mobs also have similar attributes. The player can use potions to recover HP, and gains XP and gold from defeating mobs.
# Features

    - Player and Mob classes with attributes and methods.
    - Player movement and collision detection.
    - A simple combat system.
    - A health bar and damage text display.
    - A system for spawning new mobs.
    - A level-up system for the player.
    - A rudimentary AI for the mobs, including random movement and chasing the player.

# How to Run

To run the game, navigate to the directory containing the game file in your terminal and run the command python <filename.py>. Make sure that you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.

# Future Improvements (Todo)

    - Implement a more complex AI for the mobs, including a pathfinding algorithm for chasing the player.
    - Improve the game's graphics and user interface.
    - Add more types of mobs with different attributes and behaviors.
    - Add a system for the player to buy and use items, such as weapons and armor.
    - Implement a system for saving and loading game progress.
